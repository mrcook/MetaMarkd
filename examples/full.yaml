summary: A short summary of the work.
description: A really lovely, and somewhat longer description of adventures down Rabbit holes.
excerpt: |-
  In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the
  world she was to get out again.

  The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped
  suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping
  herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.
